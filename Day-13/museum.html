    <p>Text art is visual art where words and text are the main component,
        used for aesthetic, conceptual, or emotional impact rather than just conveying information.
        It can range from digital forms like ASCII art, where images are created from characters,
        to physical artworks such as paintings, sculptures, or installations that incorporate text,
        typography, or wordplay. The primary purpose is to explore the visual and expressive qualities of language,
        often combining it with imagery to provoke thought and feeling. </p>

    When it comes to selling your art, the more information that you provide in your artwork description the better! After all, this is where your customer will turn to learn more about your piece.
    The best artwork descriptions on Artfinder comprise two sections: one detailing the inspiration behind the piece and another presenting the bare facts.The inspirational bit
    This component of the description will need to refer directly to the artwork at hand. There's no perfect formula for this, however it does need to be engaging! Remember that it should reflect you and your personality, as well as your enthusiasm for your work.
